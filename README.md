# product-landing-page-project
built a product landing page as per instructed by freecodecamp.

Focused a lot on making sure the user stories were completed succuessfully, for example: User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header". 

The user story I had issue with the most was making sure the header was to be fixed at the top of the viewport. The footer also gave me problems where it would not stick to the bottom and kept floating up to the center of the page. 

HTML semantics for accessibility and styling were also a major focus. I aspire to get better at DRY, responsive design, flexbox, accessibility, and lazy loading images as I continue my front-end developer journey.
